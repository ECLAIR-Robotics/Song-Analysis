(So cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding\nMaybe I'm just like my father, too bold\nMaybe you're just like my mother\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other?\nThis is what it sounds like\nWhen doves cry\n[Verse 3]\nTouch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)\nFeel how it trembles inside (Mhm)\nYou've got the butterflies all tied up\nDon't make me chase you\nEven doves have pride\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can you just leave me standing\nAlone in a world so cold? (World so cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding\nMaybe I'm just like my father, too bold\nMaybe you're just like my mother\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other?\nThis is what it sounds like\nWhen doves cry\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYeah, yeah\nDoo-doo woah-oh\n(Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can you just leave me standing\nAlone in a world that's so cold?
