 "lyrics": "There's a motherfucking killer on the loose\nAnd he'll destroy every single one of you\nYou'd better watch it cos he's lookin' for your ass now\nBetter lock all your doors shut the house down\nHe's making a list and he's checkin' it twice\nHe was born pissed and he's ready to slice\nHis reality ain't like yours and mine\nHe can shed blood I hope it ain't mine\nHe don't give a fuck if you're cryin' for help\nHe was born blind in the chambers of hell\nSatan gave this homeboy a licence to kill\nAnd if he comes knockin' I'mma show him the deal\n\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhen the killer showing up with a gat\nYou goin' have to grab your ass a baseball bat\nRemind this motherfucker where the home run's at\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nYou gonna have to face the moment of truth\nYou know what to do\nYou gonna to have to go and find the killer in you\n\n\nHe's got a trunk full of hatchets and shit\nBombs, gasoline, matches and shit\nAnything that make a human die quick\nCreepin' in the night like some super-sly shit\nSo scandalous! Everything about him wrong!\nChainsaw stalk none at the crack of dawn\nLeatherface is a pussy, It don't compare\nHe'll have you shitting in your motherfucking underwear\nAll you homies acting hard better get a grip\nHe'll kill your wife and your baby sleeping in the crib\nWe gotta stop him\nShut this motherfucker down\nShow his ass who runs this motherfucking town\nShow his ass who runs this motherfucking town\nSee Limp Bizkit LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhen the killer showing up with a gat\nYou goin' have to grab your ass a baseball bat\nRemind this motherfucker where the home run's at\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nYou gonna have to face the moment of truth\nYou know what to do\nYou gonna to have to go and find the killer in you\nPlant that motherfucker on the curb\n\n\nSaw the killer in you\nShow that motherfucker what the deal\nWhat's real\nNow it's real\nYeah (Kill that motherfucker)\n\n\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhen the killer showing up with a gat\nYou goin' have to grab your ass a baseball bat\nRemind this motherfucker where the home run's at\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nWhat the fuck you gonna do about that\nYou gonna have to face the moment of truth\nYou know what to do\nYou gonna to have to go and find the killer in "
