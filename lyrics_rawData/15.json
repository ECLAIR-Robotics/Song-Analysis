 "lyrics": "Down, chemical sacrament\nBlasphemous prayer\nDeliver me from this\nSo serene apocalypse\n\n\nJust make me fucking numb\nDeaf, blind and fucking dumb\nReturn to sacred sleep!\n\nThis could be my requiem\nAnd I'll feel no pain\nThis could be my requiem\nBut don't bury me too deep!\n\n\nDrain infected brine\nSickened cesspool shell of mine\nStrap up the hands of time\nAnd push the soul into the vain\n\n\nJust make me fucking numb\nDeaf, blind and fucking dumb\nReturn to sacred sleep!\n\n\nThis could be my requiem\nAnd I'll feel no pain\nThis could be my requiem\nBut don't bury me too deep!\n\n\n\"And we had better not have any of our children left when it\u2019s over, 'cause they\u2019ll parachute in here on us\nBecause we are not committing suicide, it\u2019s a revolutionary act! Calm, let's get calm\nWe had nothing we could do, we can't, we can't separate ourselves from our own people\nIt\u2019s not to be feared, it is not to be feared! It's a friend, it's a friend\nLet\u2019s be done with the agony of it\nFar, far harder to have to watch you every day die slowly\nAnd from the time you were a child to the time you get gray you're dying\nMother, mother, mother, mother, mother, please, mother, please\nPlease, please, don't... lay down your life with your child, but don't do this\nAnd we had better not have any of our children left when it's over\nLay down your life with your child\nOh, God almighty, God almighty\u2026\"\nYou might also like\n\n\nSink, suffer, self-destruct\nRise stronger, reconstruct\nSink, suffer, self-destruct\nRise stronger, reconstruct\n\n\nDispose\nDiscard\nDeny\nAnd I will feel no p"
