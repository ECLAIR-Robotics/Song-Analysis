 "lyrics": "From a throat choked by rope\nAs lunatic mob\nShackled maimed feet\nTore asunder both wings\n\nPluck my eyes out\nRip my tongue\nMake me slave to gravity\nBleed dry of tears\nWeep with blood\nLeave to atrophy\nI sought reprisal high and low\nI spew forth plagues to taint their soil\nI crept under the shadow of purity\nIn my hour of pious wane\nI turned to boundless catechism\nBehold the anathema of benediction\nSacrilege in Gethsemane manifest\nFuror Divinus!\nAnointed sin became flesh\n\nEmerge the accuser of all\nHark the universe cries forlorn\nBleeds from black lungs of hell\nDeflowered by the horns\n\nAnd so I reversed the wheel of my fortune\nStrike blind the eye of the lion\nWith every breath stolen from their lips\nI raped and raped and raped the daughters of Zion\n\nRaise the dagger Abraham\nAnd slit the throat of thy only son\nReverse the history of man\nFuck and reset the world\n\nPluck my eyes out\nRip my tongue\nMake me slave to gravity\nBleed dry of tears\nWeep with blood\nLeave my cross to atrophySee Behemoth LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also li"
