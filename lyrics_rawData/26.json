 "lyrics": "\nTell me all your plans and I'll laugh back in your face\nPreach me your religion if you're dumb enough to pray\nI tried to make a change to get a better way\nTo make a little more money\nI tried to get away to see if I could stay\nAnd look what I became honey\n\n\nWhat is it I'm after\nSearching for disaster\nWatching my whole life flash in front of my eyes\nWe've been given answers\nStill we're walking cancers\nDressed up as a life\n\n\n\nGet all your news from a corporate company\nTrade in your opinon for a gallon of gasoline, go!\nI tried to get away to see if I could stay\nAnd look what I became honey\n\n\n\nDressed up as a life\nDressed up as a life\n\nThis life is a waste of life\nThis life is a fucking lie\n\n\n\nDressed up as life\nDressed up as life\nDressed up asYou might also li"
