 "lyrics": "Go out there and fight to save this land\nBe a people's soldier\nParamilitary gun in hand\nI won't be a soldier\nI won't take no orders from no one\nStuff their fucking armies\nKilling isn't my idea of fun\n\nAnd they wanna waste my life\nThey wanna waste my time\nThey wanna waste my life\nAnd they've stolen it away\nI could be a hero\nLive and die for their 'important' cause\nA united nation\nOr an independent state with laws\nAnd rules and regulations\nThat merely cause disturbances and wars\nAnd that's what I've got now\nAll thanks to the freedom-seeking hordes\n\nAnd they wanna waste my life\nThey wanna waste my time\nThey wanna waste my life\nAnd they've stolen it away\n\nI'm not gonna be taken in\nThey said if I don't join I just can't win\nI've heard that story many times before\nAnd every time I've thrown it out the door\nStill they come up to me\nWith a different name but same old face\nI can see the connection\nWith another time and another place\nThey ain't blonde-haired or blue-eyed\nBut they think that they're the master race\nThey're nothing but blind fascists\nBrought up to hate and given lives to waste\nYou might also likeAnd they wanna waste my life\nThey wanna waste my time\nThey wanna waste my life\nAnd they've stolen it away\nWhat they want? They wanna waste my life\nThey wanna waste my time\nThey wanna waste my life\nAnd they've stolen it aw"
