 "lyrics": "If I struggle a lifetime\nWhat would my body be?\nAn empty shell\nOn which a demon fed\nCould be a heavy burden\nTo stay true to your words\nSpeak up\nI wanna silence everything\n\n\nIf I got no plan\nDoesn't mean that I get what I want for free\nIf I got no meaning\nWould you force me to a place where I make sense\n'Cause nothing lasts forever...!\n\nHow do I get home?\nEverything revolves around me\nIf I can't find myself?\nIt's so completely fake\nHow do I get home?\nEverything revolves around me\nIf even you can't help?\nDark nights on my soul\n\n\nI deny failure\nI ignite\nWoe is on my misery\nShe wins all their eyes\nRealise what defies our fate\nThis is not me, this is me\nSo if I struggle a lifetime\nWhat good would that do?\n\n\nIf I got a plan\nDoesn't have to stop the feeling inside\nIf I do make sense\nWould you drag me down?\n'Cause nothing lasts forever...!\nYou might also like\nHow do I get home?\nEverything revolves around me\nIf I can't find myself?\nIt's so completely fake\nHow do I get home?\nEverything revolves around me\nIf even you can't help?\nDark nights on my sou"
