 "lyrics": "We can agree\nA wicked decision\nNothing's wrong with you and me\n\nA week in the forest\nA week in the fog\nYou'll be sad to hear that\nI I I I I was robbed\n\nAnd we're gonna own it\nA fist to the voice\nAnd we've found the music\nWhy did you try at the choice?\nAnd decapitation\nFor failing to see\nNothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation\n\n\nDon't stop talkin' to me please\nBaby cut me all to pieces\nIf you really want hell, hell\nRipped apart by the crows not the vultures\nNo one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation\n\nSpeak in the garden\nYou burn down the trees\nI'll leave out the teasin'\nWhile you are down on one knee\n\nNever is heavy\nAnd heavy is fine\nBut only in the street man\nYou ate your words wrong this time\n\nIt's wicked where you tread\nShot an arrow in your head\nSince the apple wasn't there, yeah\nRipped apart by the crows and the vultures\nIgnore me in the parking lot\nI'm petrified by conversation\nYou might also likeIt's wicked where you tread\nThey shot an arrow at your head\nSince the apple wasn't there, yeah\nWe're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures\nIgnore me in the parking lot\nI'm petrified by conversat"
