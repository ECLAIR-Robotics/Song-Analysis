 "lyrics": "Well, I see, I feel, on my way\nYou close your eyes, scared to think what you might see\nA world that spends more to kill than to cure\nLiving, writhing, diseased, so unpure\n\n\nIt hardens me, the things I see\nBut I won't break, it gives me strength\nThat's right!\n\nOur suffering, won't always be!\nWe'll dominate, this nation on fire!\n\n\nThe media, it blinds our eyes\nA people, divided and force fed lies\nThe black and white societies corrode\nWarring, hating, blind, a rage explodes\n\n\nSo take my hand, across this land\nI won't go down, stand my ground\nYeah, that's right!\n\n\nOur suffering, won't always be!\nWe'll dominate, this nation on fire!\nGo!\n\n\nThis nation's built on fighting war after war\nAnd for my brothers, I will fight and stand for\n'Cause I won't break, your truth is fake\nIf blood ran red, you'd leave me for dead\nYou might also like\nA nation on fire!\nA nation on fire!\n\n\nYou tell me peace, well, I hear gunshots all night\nThe scars I have, I've earned, 'cause I've had to fight\nAn endless pain, and it won't change\nWe just sat by and watched this world die\n\n\nA nation on fire!\nA nation on fi"
