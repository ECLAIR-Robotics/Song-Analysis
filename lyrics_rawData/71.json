 "lyrics": "And I'm here to give you more than your heavenly dose\nI think you better listen 'cos I know who you are\nAnd I think that you should treat me like a superstar\nBecause I'm more than just a human I'm a gift to all of you\nAnd I'm here to make sure that my message gets through\nI wonder if you're really all as dumb as you look\nOr are you smart enough to learn the rules in my book\nI hope you understand that the knowledge I bring\nPuts me in the position of a god or a king\n'cos I'm blessed with the gift of the magic touch\nAnd I wouldn't say that I'm asking for to much\nAll you have to do is get down on your knees and pray\nAnd I promise you the remedy is on its way\nBut you can never be like me so don't waste your time\nBecause I reign supreme and my position is divine\nWhat's wrong with being self possessed?\nNobody's satisfied with being second best\nI've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed\nAnd I've got to get it off my chest\n\nI'm the biggest the best better than the rest better than the rest x4\n\nI'm not afraid of competition 'cos I know that I'm the best\nAnd you haven't got a chance to even pass my little test\nEven if you wanted to you couldn't pay the price\nThere ain't no room for losers in my perfect paradise\n'cos life is always based upon the weight of you success\nSo I'll make sure that I get the most and nothing less\nIf I love myself then everyone will love me to\nAnd there's nothing you can do for me that I can't do\n\nWhat's wrong with being self possessed?\nNobody's satisfied with being second best\nI've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed\nAnd I've got to get it off my chest\n\nI'm the biggest the best better then the rest better then the rest x4\n\nSo welcome to my kingdom and enjoy your little stay\nEven if you can't afford it I'll still make you pay\nSo you better come and get it and enjoy it while you can\nDon't tell me that you're dumb enough to think I give a damn\nI couldn't care less about what you achieve\nAnd there's only one thing that you have to believe\nThe only thing important that you have to understand\nIs that no matter what you say i'm still a god I really am\nYou might also likeI'm the biggest the best better than the rest better than the rest"
