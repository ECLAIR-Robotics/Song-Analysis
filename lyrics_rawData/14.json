 "lyrics": "Behind these eyes\nThe shell seems so empty\nThough I wonder if anything lives inside?\n\nI want to live\nI wish I was dead\n\nMy heart aches to bleed\nI'm cheated from what I see\nFreedom holds a double-edge for me\nI look in your eyes and see...\nI want to live\nI wish I was dead\n\nI don't want to think\nI'm stuck here and I know it\nI don't want to see\nMake me close my eyes\n\nI want to live\nI wish I was dead\n\nLife's cold\nAnd it reaches inside\nI need to feel\nBut turn my mind off\nThe desperation begins\nFrom the start I see the end\nNot right, I'm not right, you're not right\nI've got to close my eyes\n\nI look in your eyes\nAnd see its always this way\nLive the lie and take a dive\nJust to make it die\n\nI want to live\nI wish I was dead\nI've just got to close my eyes\nI've got to close my eyes\nI've got to close my eyesYou might also li"
