 "lyrics": "It's cold and it's\nSmooth and it's\nA hard shade of white\nAnd everybody needs to lick the surface clean\nBut it never tastes better\n\nWhite blooms to white and freezes white again\nClose it before something crawls in\nCommit it, leave it, get away - we always\nDrop our good side\n\nBeing good gets you stuff\nBeing stuff gets you good\nGood stuff gets you being\nAnd wheelin' and dealin' and squealin'\nShit lives forever\n\nThey have no legs, but chase us anyway\nWipe the shadow of your best friend\nGave birth to something we don't want to be\nWe drop our good side\n\n\nYou can't kill it!!!!\n\n\nEat is just as deep as you can fuck it\nSo cough it up or go down\nAnd there's only one thing that separates\nA man...\n\nShit lives forever (x2)\n\nWe'll retire with a turd on our lips\nUnder a pair of knowing eyes\nI'm gonna take a few down with me\nAnd drop my good side\nYou might also like x4\nYou can't kill it!!!!\n\n\nTake it from our drummer, \"Puff\"\nBeing good it gets you... st"
