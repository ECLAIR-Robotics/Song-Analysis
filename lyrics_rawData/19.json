 "lyrics": "I spent it all\nI\nI spent it all\nOn the bag\nOn the drag\nI\nI spent it all\n\nThe sun comes up, the tide rolls out\nThe trucks roll by the park, still a park\nWhere children play, pick up stones\nAnything to make them feel less alone - he's alone\nHis mind is his own town\nWhere his thoughts run aground\nThey fall all over and down\nI\nI spent it all\nI\nI spent it all\nOn the bag (can't you see)\nOn the drag\nI\nI spent it all\n\nThe sun comes down, the tide rolls back\nWe crawl our way back to the house we call home\nHe holds his home in the palm of his hand (and says)\nAnd he says, and he says\nYou are my everyone\nYou are my anyone\nYou are my anytime\nYou are my everytime\nYou are my anywhere\nYou are my everywhere\nYou are my anytime\nYou are my anytime\nYou are my anytime\nYou are my everywhere\nYou are mine\n\nAnd he says, and I say\nAnd he says, and I say, I say\nYou are my everyone\nYou are my anyone\nYou are my anytime\nYou are my everytime\nYou are my anywhere\nYou are my everywhere\nYou are my anytime\nYou are my anytime\nEverywhere\nAnywhere\nEverywhere\nAnywhereYou might also li"
