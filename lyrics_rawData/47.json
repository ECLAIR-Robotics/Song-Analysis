 "lyrics": "Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh, yeah\nOoh-ooh\n\n\nI never needed you to be strong\nI never needed you for pointing out my wrongs\nI never needed pain, I never needed strain\nMy love for you was strong enough, you should've known\nI never needed you for judgment\nI never needed you to question what I spent\nI never asked for help, I take care of myself\nI don't know why you think you got a hold on me\n\nAnd it's a little late for conversations\nThere isn't anything for you to say\nAnd my eyes hurt, hands shiver\nSo look at me and listen to me, because\n\n\nI don't want to stay another minute\nI don't want you to say a single word\nHush hush; hush hush\nThere is no other way, I get the final say, because\nI don't want to do this any longer\nI don't want you, there's nothing left to say\nHush hush; hush hush\nI've already spoken, our love is broken\nBaby, hush hush\n\n\nI never needed your corrections\nOn everything from how I act to what I say\nI never needed words, I never needed hurt\nI never needed you to be there every day\nI'm sorry for the way I let go\nOn everything I wanted when you came along\nBut I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated\nI know next to you is not where I belong\nYou might also like\nAnd it's a little late for explanations\nThere isn't anything that you can do\nAnd my eyes hurt, hands shiver\nSo you will listen when I say (Baby)\n\n\nI don't want to stay another minute\nI don't want you to say a single word\nHush hush; hush hush\nThere is no other way, I get the final say, because\nI don't want to do this any longer\nI don't want you, there's nothing left to say\nHush hush; hush hush\nI've already spoken, our love is broken\nBaby, hush hush\n\n\nAt first I was afraid, I was petrified\nKept thinking I could never live without you by my side\nBut I spent oh so many nights\nThinking how you did me wrong\nBut I grew strong\nI learned how to carry on\nOh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah (Hush hush; hush hush)\nI've already spoken\nOur love is broken, baby\nOh no, not I, I will survive\nOh, as long as I know how to love\nI know I'll stay alive\nI've got all my life to live\nI've got all my love to give, but I will survive\nI will survive, hey, hey!\n\nHush hush; hush hush\nThere is no other way\nI get the final say\n\n\nI don't want to do this any longer\nI don't want you, there's nothing left to say\nHush hush, hush hush, I've already spoken\nOur love is broken\nBaby, hush hu"
