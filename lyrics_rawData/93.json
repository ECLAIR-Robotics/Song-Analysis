 "lyrics": "True friends stab you in the front\nKeep you from getting what you want\nWhen one more fix could kill you\nThey help you realize that\n\n\nYou're more and less than you first had believed\nYou've so much to give and there's so much you need\nShortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe\nThree thousand miles just to learn\n\nAll that's gold does not all shine\nAnd helping words aren't always kind\nWhen one more kiss could kill you\nThey help you realize that\n\n\nYou're more and less than you first had believed\nYou've so much to give and there's so much you need\nShortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe\nThree thousand miles just to learn\n\n\nHow to let my guard down\nAccept the fire has spread among us\nAnd if you're feeling all right\nYou've got to play it again\nYou've got to play it againSee Thrice LiveGet tickets as low as $39You might also li"
