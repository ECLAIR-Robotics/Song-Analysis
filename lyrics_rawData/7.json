 "lyrics": "I'll never be the same, breaking decency\nDon't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots\nI've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem\nThat's been stomped away from every single dream\nBut it's something else that brought us peace\nKeep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash\nBut I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone\nI think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong!\n\n\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nThey fuck in my head!\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck it, you bitch!\n\nYou and me are here alone\nFace flat along the edge of the grass\nBut I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of thugs\nMy parents made me strong to look up that glass\nSo why should I try? Act like I'm a little pissed off\nWith all that shit that needs to stay back in the shell\nYour punk ass made it up, now your fuckin' mind is gone\nShould've never glorified, now you're right!\n\n\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nThey fuck in my head!\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck it, you bitch!\n\n\nBitch, you don't know me\nShut up, you don't know me\nSqueal like a pig when you\nPickpocket, big fuckin' head!\n\n\nWell, I'll tell you about my blunt stack\nWhat's coming back, Jack? We'll turn back\nCurse, fighting their words, tell them that you fucking heard\nI mean, they know that's what's coming, nigga, you quitter\nI'm thinking about something naughty and won't tell anybody\nSo, thinking of me by now, but you go grab it\nI'd like to think, for who I down this shit\nI belong where they be\nBecause we cannot get back those lives\nYou might also like\nWe exist to please, understand?\nLove hates blacks, shades, and all the players\nMr. P.I.G., could I fuckin' see?\nShorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity\nAnd to the jury can't be no turn is all\nMy skin looks colored, does that mean I'm burnt?\n'Cause your punk ass made it up, your fuckin' mind was gone\nShould've never glorified, wrong!\n\n\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck it!\nThey fuck in my head!\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, suck\nSuck, suck, suck, you bad bo"
