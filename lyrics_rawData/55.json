 "lyrics": "Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls\nWhy can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls\nIf you're delusional, your call will be transferred to the mother ship\nUgh\nYes, I like the drug\n\n\nI'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you\nPlutonium lore, what this is, what this for\nFeel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor\nSpit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers\nScared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls\nDragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls\nCan't imagine what's fit to happen when I get to flashing, see the small\nShrink to a fraction of what they're lacking and less than that in no time at all\nCan't believe they have the gaul to try and act\nLike they\u2019re not trapped between these walls\nBring it (Bring it)\nKill it\n\nBring it, bring that shit heated\nSling it, bring back that shit, kill it\nBring it, bring that shit heated\nSling it, bring back that shit, kill it (Kill it)\nBring it, bring that shit, that shit\nBring it, bring back that shit, bring that\nBring it, bring that shit, that shit\nBring it, bring back that shit, bring that\nBring it, bring that shit heated\nSling it, bring back that shit, kill it (Kill it, kill it, kill it)\n\n\nSometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there\nDoes it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here\nAnd if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls\nAnd if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all\nToo much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad\nBeen there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand\nBut in the end I guess I just don\u2019t give a damn, twist a gram\nAnd keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man\nJudge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low\nBut I do know what you do not speak of, don\u2019t know but it shows\nTry to hide but I see who you are because I just know\nKeep talking but you already said too much, there you go\nHow it is now's how it always was, that\u2019s on my blood\nHow it is now's how it always was, that\u2019s on my blood\nYou might also like\nBring it, bring that shit heated\nSling it, bring back that shit, kill it\nBring it, bring that shit heated\nSling it, bring back that shit, kill it (Kill it)\nBring it, bring that shit, that shit\nBring it, bring back that shit, bring that\nBring it, bring that shit, that shit\nBring it, bring back that shit, bring that\nBring it, bring that shit heated\nSling it, bring back that shit, kill it (Kill it, kill it, kill it)\n\n\nSee my blood spill drip, by chances\nTry to chill, quit, cause I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance\nTongue hissing, serpent chants\nCome again work it in, yeah just like that\nWe paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh\nAnd make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget\nAll praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it\nCheck it, bring it, kill it\nOn everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat\nAnd die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope\nTied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke\nGot to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before\nI end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane\nStaring at the ceiling, in the dark\nTrying not to let the feeling, tear you apart\nBut the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop\nTell yourself it's almost over, but it's not\n\nThere\nOver, over\nTh-, there\nOver, over\nTh-, there\nOver, over\nThere\nOver, ove"
