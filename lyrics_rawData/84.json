 "lyrics": "Skinny little bitch\nStaring at the mirror\nIn your desperation\n'Till you disappear\n\n\nAnd you would be oh-so-dumb\nTo fuck with me\n'Cause baby, you're much too young\nTo end up with me\n\nYour bedroom wall's fallen down\nAnd everyone can see you now\nYour bedroom walls, they sell for cheap\nYou lie, you lie alone, you lie alone, you never sleep\nAh, you never sleep\n\n\nOw! Skinny little bitch\nPrayin' to the Lord\nPrayin' for some salvation\n'Cause she\u2019s oh-so-bored\n\n\nIn my vile sex horror\nAnd my cheap drugs hell\nAnd all the things you'll never\nLive to tell\n\n\nAnd you will never see the light\nI'll just obscure it out of spite\nJust a nasty piece of work\nCome on, come on, baby, come on, baby, let it burn\nOh baby, does it hurt?\nYou might also like\nBorn of foul creation\nBorn of sour milk, cocaine filth\n\n\nYou staggered here on broken glass\nSo I could kick your scrawny ass\nAll the drugs and all the burns\nWhat a nasty, what a nasty, nasty piece of work\nOh baby, does it hurt?\nOh baby, just go slower\nOh baby, just go lower\n\n\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bitch\nSkinny little bit"
