 "lyrics": "A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masters\nTo the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit\nA little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits\nWe're still here running 'round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing\nDon't walk away when I talk, I'm telling you \"turn around, mister.\"\nI got a permanent bop, who the hell do I think I am not?\nAnd I'm twice as hot as about half of hell\nI get lighthouse lit up, get down, Diduck\nThe boy got a barracuda bite, you can tell\n\nGot hope for the living, got prayers for the dead\nIn the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head\nGot kush for the pain 'cause the world is dangerous\nDriven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust\nSomewhere between love and lust, a nut get bust and a baby get made\nIt seems that trouble trouble us and follow us like all our days\nIn every holy book it says we suffer, that's what it is\nSo riddle me this; from the womb to the tomb, why do we fight to live?\n\n\nA little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masters\nTo the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit\nA little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits\nWe're still here running 'round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing\nGot hope for the living, got prayers for the dead\nIn the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head\nGot kush for the pain, the world is dangerous\nDriven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust\n\n\nYou say you wanna be my leader, I think you wanna be my God\nYou say you on the side of the righteous (right) I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong\nThere's truth where the filth is, there's lies in the law\nYou want a whore with a white dress, I want a wife in a thong\nYou love fear and division (don't you?) I don't fuck with your symbolism\nI don't give a fuck about power, I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid\nCut an ear from a mouse hat, go Van Gogh on a house rat\nFind another mind to devour, motherfucker I'm really not hearing it\nYou might also like\nA pope is a fraud, a church is a lie\nA queen is the same damn thing, you should pray to your fake god that she die\nGod really exists? I'll tell you, like this: it reside inside\nAnd anybody tell you different, just selling you religion, tryna keep your ass in line\nI kill my masters, I mentor none\nThat means when I die, that's it, my style is gone; I'm a one of one\nOne half of the great RTJ\nDefeated the odds, went to war with the gods\nEarned all our scars and came back straight (RTJ)\n\n\nA little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masters\nTo the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit\nA little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits\nWe're still here running round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing\nGot hope for the living, got prayers for the dead\nIn the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head\nGot kush for the pain 'cause the world is dangerous\nDriven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust\nAngel Dust\nAngel Dust\n24Embed"
