 "lyrics": "Earth's a padded cell\nDefanged and declawed\nI'm living in hell\nIt's a paradise fraud\nStraight jacket minds\nIn line to be old\nTelling me to let time slip through my teeth\nWell I'm no fool\nI'm going to town\nManic reactions are always a buzz\nI'm suspect, the stranger in disguise\nIt's forced itself upon me\nSomething I can't hide\n\nSee it in... maniacs\nTheir eyes... maniacs maniacs maniacs\n\n\nLooking at you, inside of you\nThrough your eyes, behind your mind\nLooking at you, inside of you\nI'm invisible, nowhere to hide\nI'm obscene. the living dead\nSee the flys feed off your head\nLooking at you, I'm inside of you\nIt's walden two, but the flower's dead\n\n\nSee it in... maniacs\nTheir eyes... maniacs maniacs maniacs\n\n\nEarth's a padded cell\nDefanged and declawed\nI'm living in hell\nIt's a paradise fraud\nStraight jacket minds\nIn line to be old\nTelling me to want\nLet time slip through my teeth\nWell I'm not the fool\nI'm going to town\nManic reactions are always a buzz\nI'm suspect, the stranger in disguise\nIt's forced itself upon me\nSomething I can't hide\nYou might also like\nSee it in... maniacs\nTheir eyes... maniacs maniacs mani"
