 "lyrics": "Blind by pain, deaf by lies\nSmell of freedom violently cuts\nForgiveness\nPower to a being never dies\nSuffer in truth's narrow passage saw\nWeak solutions stabbed to not know\nThe smile of obliteration's face\n\nPenetrating through the void of life\nA dance with the dead\nBuried in oblivion, stolen from the mind\nConstant starving, never fed\nContaminated life is fading\nLaughing in my face\nSuffer in deception\nManipulated not to feel\nSlain beliefs, abandoned dreams\nA life of misery\n\nSuffer in truth\nSuffer in truth\n\nThe wounds of a soul in pain\nA mirror of life\nDreams all in vain\nLife will always be sealed\n\nI see\nUnseen\nI feel\nUnseen\n\nSuffer in truth\nSuffer\nSuffer in truthSee Meshuggah LiveGet tickets as low as $151You might also li"
