 "lyrics": "(Say peace) Peace!\nDirty, Ol' Dirty Bastard\n(Say it, say it again)\nThe Genius! Genius (The Genius)\nThe Genius, the Genius\n\n\nI'll grab the mic and I'll damage ya\nCrush your whole stamina\nHere comes the medical examiner\nOne verse, then you're out for the count\nBring the ammonia! Make sure he sniffs the right amount\nWake him up and then ask him why did he attend this\nCompetition to get a asssss kickin' so tremendous?\nBoy, you know you shouldn't bother this\nLeave me alone like the son said, G, or he'll be fatherless!\n'Cause I got the Asiatic flow mixed with disco\nRoll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Cristo\nAnd MC's start to vanish\nI stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin' Spanish!\nYo, he wasn't from Panama\nAsked him how he get so dark, the nigga said \"Sun-tanama!\"\nHe responded so fast, he made me laugh\nHa-ha-ha, HARARRRH! Then I scared his ass!\nKicked the hundred strongest rhymes\nI brought out the punk in him\nCaught him with a strong Five Deadly Venom\nTold him enter the Wu-Tang\nWitness the Shaolin slang that'll crush the shit you bring\nAnd watch your ass take a big fall, why?!\nMy Main Source is like a Friendly Game of stickball\nAnd as you step up to bat, man, I play The Riddler\nTry to Jew me for a rhyme, and I change to Hitler\nGo out like a Nazi\nYou'll be wishin' your fuckin' ass stayed home and played Yahtzee!\nOr watchin' Happy Days, sweatin' Potsie\nWith Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and Chachi\nWu, who! Who?! Me gettin' wrecked, so I'm through\nLike a ten-and-a-half foot gettin' in a seven shoe\nNow picture that with a Minolta\nHave your ass doin' some Night Fever shit like John Travolta\nI come strong, I make knowledge born\nI flip the script and rock on from P.M. past the fuckin' Dawn!\nPass the Hammer, you're broke down\nEnglish grammar, what? What?\nCan't understand it? Here's the panorama\nA complete view of how I defeat you\nShould've stepped to those fuckin' kids who tried to beat you!\nYeah, I bust that ass before\nYou ran to Texas and came back, but forgot the chainsaw!\nAnd when I perform a massacre\nBetter be comin' with some motherfuckin' shit that's spectacular\nCrush the personal vendetta\nWell, you just better start steppin' to your raggedy-ass Jetta\nPut the pedal to the metal\nYou and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle\nAs I pass the bone, kicks your every measure\nIt's not a Newport, but it's still live with pleasure\nC'mon, don't be silly\nJust a bag of sensimilli rolled up in a Motown Philly\nI used to write all the time when I smoked\nGrabbed the mic, then I like, kinda went for broke\nWith visually concepts, strongest rhymes or biceps\nLyrically speakin', three to four rhymes a choke\nUhh! Some think they be harmin' this, claimin' they be bombin' this\nBut they still remains anonymous\nI pull strings like Jimi Hendrix\nRhyme on beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks\nI teach the truth to the youth\nI say, \"Hey, youth! Here's the truth, better start wearin' bulletproof\"\nArm yourself with a shield\n'Fore you get trapped up, just like the children in the cornfieldYou might also li"
