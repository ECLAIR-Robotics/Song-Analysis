 "lyrics": "Fear, it's all the same\nShould I evolve to tend to these sights\nSaid out loud then said again\nIf fate's so wrong you'll start to feel light-headed\n\n\nBy my admission nothing grows\nJust a longer list of unsorted laws\n\n\nSo why then has all my life made no sound?\nAnd are your eyes closing even now?\nMy life made no sound\nI fear your eyes closing\n\nRevolting man, this sacred chain\nBrought down to trial\nNo better man could fail the way\nYou needed all, keep close the vein of empty thoughts\n\n\nThe finest river, the ravens tend\nAll along insisting, we're worlds away\n\n\nSo why then has all my life made no sound?\nAnd are your eyes closing even now?\nMy life made no sound\nI fear your eyes closing\n\n\nBehold the lost\nBehold a Band-Aid\nBehold the lost\nBehold a Band-Aid\n\nThese shameful metaphors\nFought it through the teeth\nShameful metaphors\nBiting at your heels\nShameful metaphors\nFought it cheek to cheek\nYou might also like\nSo why then has all my life made no sound? (These shameful metaphors)\nAnd are your eyes closing even now?\nMy life made no sound (These shameful metaphors)\nI fear your eyes closi"
