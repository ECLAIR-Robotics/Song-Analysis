 "lyrics": "There's no more cops outside\nIt just takes away\nIt's kinda why I'll talk to you\nIt's hella sensitive\n\n\nAlways the same old taste just new injury\nWell I'll wear the claws if you'd like that\nYeah if you'd like that we can ride on a black horse\nA great new wave Hesperian death horse\nI can call you when I get back\nYeah when I get back I will call\n\nBut don't speak, don't say nothing\nIn case we ever do meet again\nSomething's wrong with you\nWell I hope we never do meet again\n\n\nYou always sharpen your teeth 'cause you're like that\nAnd you're like that every time you pull heart back\nAnd her compact's carving deeper in your lap\nI would call but I forget where the phone is at\nGuess I'll talk to you when I get back\nYeah when I get back I will talk\n\n\nBut don't speak, don't say nothing\nIn case we ever should meet again\nThere are some things wrong with you\nI hope we never do meet again\nI hope we never do meet again\nI hope we never do meet again\n\n\nSomething's wrong with you\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nSomething's wrong with you\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nSomething's wrong with you\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nYou might also like\nBut don't speak, don't say nothing\nIn case we have to meet again\n'Cause something's wrong with you\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\n\n\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet again\nAnd I hope we never do meet ag"
