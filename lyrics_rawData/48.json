Slow down\nFeel when I'm in doubt\n\n\nI need something beautiful\nTo fill the space we've taken up\nI need something to feel real again before I go numb\n\nDownward spiral a kaleidoscope view\nIs what you're seeing saying so jaded\nThe picture I drew\nCome again, come again, come again\n\n\nWait, take, wait\nWhy can't you help me?\nWait, take, wait, take\nFeel when I'm in doubt\n\n\nI need something beautiful\nTo fill the space we've taken up\nI need something to feel real again before I go numb\n\nWait, take, wait\nWhy can't you help me?\nWait, take, wait, take\nFeel when I'm in doubt\nFeel when I'm in doubt\n\n\nI need something beautiful\nTo fill the space we've taken up\nI need something to feel real again before I go numb\nAre you alive?\nI need something beautiful\nTo fill the space we've taken up\nI need something to feel real again before I go numb\nYou might also like\nAre you alive? Are you alive?\nI'm alive, when I'm in doubt, I'm alive\nWhen in doubt, I'm ali"
